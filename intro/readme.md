Questions:
> What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?

1) Reading and writing
2) Attention to detail
3) Spotting differences

> Please explain these three skills in your own words.

**1) Reading and writing**
If you are unable to read, you will not be able to code. Code is a language — a particularly awesome language because it is 100% cognates, but a language all the same!

If you are unable to type, you will struggle to keep up.

**2) Attention to detail**
It only takes a single misplaced character to cause an error in your whole program.

**3) Spotting differences**
Spotting differences will allow you to see what you did differently from correct code, allowing you to catch errors.

> Why do you need to not copy and paste?

Typing things out allows you to practice, making you familiar with the different keystrokes you need to code.

> Why is Practice and Persistence important?

Once you have done it so much that you don't need to think about it, you'll be able to do it — even when you're not having a good day.
