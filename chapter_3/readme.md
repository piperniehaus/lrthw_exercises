>Notice the math seems "wrong"? There are no fractions, only whole numbers.
>You need to use a "floating point" number, which is a number with a decimal point, as in 10.5, or 0.89, or even 3.0.

Floating point numbers 'float' between numbers, while fixnums are only whole numbers. By using a single floating point number, you can ensure that the result will also be a float.
