***Use ''' (triple-single-quote) instead.
Can you see why you might use that instead of """?***

Single quotes do not take as many escape sequences as double quotes. Therefore, they allow us to see the escapes as text. We'd want to use them when we want to write out escape sequences in order to read them.
